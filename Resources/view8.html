<b>Tribes FAQ </b><br><br>
<b>What is Tribes?</b><br>
Tribes is location-based mobile application that allows you to join a temporary community (i.e. “tribe”) with others. The tribe can be made for people who attend the same concert, convention, school, or even for people who just live in the same city. The possibilities are endless when creating or joining a tribe based on a common interest. <br><br>
<b>How do I use the Tribes application?</b><br>
To get started, simply click the “Join” button and choose which tribe you’d like to join. Then you can see a map of where your tribe members are currently located and chat with other members of you tribe.<br><br>
<b>Can I switch tribes, or join more than one?</b><br>
You can switch tribes at any time by hitting the “Join” button and selecting a different tribe of your choice. You can only be a member of one tribe at a time, however.<br><br>
<b>How does the chat feature work?</b><br>
Our chat feature uses your Twitter account. When you hit the “Chat” button you are taken to the Tribes group Twitter feed. If you want to chat with the group, hit the “Log In” button on the page and enter your Twitter account info. If you don’t have a Twitter account you can sign up for one at twitter.com; you will not be able to communicate with others without a Twitter account.<br><br>
